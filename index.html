    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer"> 
      <h3>To protect your website and customers' data, it's crucial to implement a comprehensive security strategy. I recommend the following measures:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Conduct regular automated testing on your website with and without trusted tools (third-party applications) to identify and address any security vulnerabilities. Also, conduct mock attacks to simulate real-world scenarios and identify weaknesses in your security defences.</li>
      <li>Implement strong password policies, two-factor authentication, and access controls to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
      <li>Sanitize data to prevent attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).</li>
      <li>Use Continuous Deployment/Continuous Integration (CI/CD) to catch bugs, check security, and improve quality.</li>
      <li>Implement secure authentication and authorization protocols to protect user accounts and data.</li>
      <li>Implement automatic user timeout to prevent unauthorized access by logging out users after a period of inactivity.</li>
      <p>By implementing these security measures, you can help ensure the security of your website and customers' data.</p>
